# Linear-Regression-Application
An application that reads excel files and performs linear regression on data to give predictions for parameters provided.

It does not use TensorFlow or Keras, all the functions are handwritten.

Then data is normalized before processing and predictions can be made based upon the data fed. 

The data given in the excel file contains:
Row1: The size of the plot of a house.
Row2: The number of bedrooms in the house.

Row3: The price for the house.

Parameters should be fed into the GUI seperated by a space.
